# Project Instructions

The goal of this project is to give you practice with:
- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls

On top of that, I want to introduce you to the topic of Natural Language Processing. NLPs leverage machine learning and deep learning create a program that can interpret natural human speech. Systems like Alexa, Google Assistant, and many voice interaction programs are well known to us, but understanding human speech is an incredibly difficult task and requires a lot of resources to achieve. Full disclosure, this is the Wikipedia definition, but I found it to be a clear one:

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence
concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to
process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

You could spend years and get a masters degree focusing on the details of creating NLP systems and algorithms. Typically, NLP programs require far more resources than individuals have access to, but a fairly new API called Aylien has put a public facing API in front of their NLP system. We will use it in this project to determine various attributes of an article or blog post.

## Getting started


`cd` into your new folder and run:
- `npm install`

## Setting up the API

The Aylien API is perhaps different than what you've used before. It has you install a node module to run certain commands through, it will simplify the requests we need to make from our node/express backend.

### Step 1: Signup for an API key
First, you will need to go [here](https://developer.aylien.com/signup). Signing up will get you an API key. Don't worry, at the time of this course, the API is free to use up to 1000 requests per day or 333 intensive requests. It is free to check how many requests you have remaining for the day.



- [ ] Create a new ```.env``` file in the root of your project 

- [ ] Fill the .env file with your API keys like this:
```
API_ID=**************************
API_KEY=**************************
```

...Not that you would want to do that. This means that our updated API credential settings will look like this:
```javascript
// set aylien API credentials
// NOTICE that textapi is the name I used, but it is arbitrary. 
// You could call it aylienapi, nlp, or anything else, 
//   just make sure to make that change universally!
var textapi = new aylien({
  application_id: process.env.API_ID,
  application_key: process.env.API_KEY
});
```
## Step 2: Project Setup

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- `npm install`

- `npm run build-prod`

- `npm run start`

open your browser 
enter link `localhost:5000`
